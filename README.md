# JCache (JSR107) Examples

A bunch of examples I use in my talk on JCache.

* Simple Cache and Configuration
* CacheLoader for read-through to a back-end, maybe an RDBMS
* CacheWriter for write-through to a back-end
* CacheListeners with Filters, to get callbacks on Cache events.
* EntryProcessors to show data processing in-situ, good for distributed caches.

## Getting Started.

In the pom.xml I have included 3 different JCache providers

1. Hazelcast
2. EHCache
3. Oracle Coherence

WARNING : To use Oracle Coherence you'll have to download the jars manually from their downloadsite and install them
to you local maven repo.

You should be able to switch the providers by changing the String passed to the CachingProvider...
```
        // Acquire the default cache provider
        CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider(CACHING_PROVIDER_HAZELCAST);
```
